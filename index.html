            <p>Dear momo,</p>
            <p>
            I can't believe it has been more than 2 years since we first met.
            Valentine's day is coming up and I was going through all our memories together
            thinking about what would be a beautiful thing to get you. While going through these old
            photos I couldn't stop smiling the whole time. I realized what could be more beautiful
            than to take you through this journey we have been through again. To take you through
            how we fell in love deeper and deeper with every passing day for the past 2 years.
            </p>

                    <p>I can't believe this is where we first met. The first time I saw you was in between
                    a sea of people, but as soon as I saw you I couldn't take my eyes off you. I don't regret not
                    taking a picture that day, because everything about that day is in my head, clear as if 
                    it just happened yesterday.</p>

                    showing up at your building and seeing you walk towards me and all I could think was -
                    Wow! She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, and she is my girlfriend! 
                    I was so shocked that I went in for a handshake instead of a hug!</p>

                    twice the whole time we were there. We just enjoyed each other's company so much

                    hand or kayaking or exploring the streets on the scooty, I just had the best time with you.
                    Even just laying in bed at the hotel watching a movie was memorable.

                    showed you that wristband and I knew you loved it! We didn't know a lot of the songs
                    he sang but just vibing with you alongside me and seeing you happy and excited made
                    it so memorable for me!

                    when we didn't get the tickets. But then you had that big smile on your face when we got the
                    Abu Dhabi tickets. I still remember the tears in your eyes
                    when they played Fix You. I am so lucky to have experienced that with the love of my life.
